> A very simple RPG game made using the Godot engine

I've wanted to play around with Godot for a while now, and making this game has been a great learning experience.

Below you'll find an exagerrated list of features this game includes (just for fun)

Features include:
* Island setting
* Defeat endless hordes of skeletons
* Help Fiona find her necklace for a handsome reward (of some XP and a single potion)
* Level up your character by defeating enemies (to no effect)
* Health and mana potions
* Artificial Intelligence

I followed [this series of tutorials](https://www.davidepesce.com/godot-tutorials/) to make this.

If you want to play it, the `Builds` folder includes executables for macOS and Windows. I've only tested the macOS build since I do not have a windows machine to test on, but if the Godot documentation is to be believed, it should work.
